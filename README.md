* Image Fusion Framework
  * We have extended our PDF to image fusion with feature interaction. Considering the properties of image fusion, we transformed the predicted $p_{true}$ to the gradient obtained by backpropagation to get Mono Confidence(MC), based on the positive correlation between gradient and loss, we construct reliable multimodal fusion weights by gradient that satisfy the generalization theory to integrate multimodal features.
